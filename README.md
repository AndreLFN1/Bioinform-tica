## Bioinformatics

The ideia of this repository is to learn and add some code I am thinking about and creating. The basic starting ideia is playing a little bit with genomics, lists tuples, dictionaries and text in Python. In the future 
my plan is to add some data science stuff as well, when I learn it properly (or not so much).



1) The first code I have added was my solution for a counting nucleotide problem at https://rosalind.info/problems/dna/ . It's a general purpose program to count nucleotides within a .txt file or given by the user in python.
