#This is a resolution for a exercice on https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/

#The main idea is to generate a program able to count the number of nucleotides in a sequence. 
#I have made it to count a sequence wrote by the user or taken from a .txt file. 
#******************************************************************


#This general purpose function counts the nucleotides in a string looking for G, C, A and T
def counting_nucleotides(sequence):
    
    sequence = sequence.upper() #formating
    
    #validation: further coding intending to not let the user put other things than nucleotides in the sequence
    
    #defining the dictionary and the nucleotide list for the next loop
    dic_nuc = {'C' : 0, 'G' : 0 , 'A': 0, 'T' : 0}
    list_nuc = ['C', 'G', 'A', 'T']
    
    #this loop intends to intends to add the number of C, T, A and G to the dic_nuc dictionary
    i = 0
    while i< len(list_nuc):
        dic_nuc[f'{list_nuc[i]}'] = sequence.count(f'{list_nuc[i]}')
        i += 1
    print(dic_nuc)


#starting the program
print('Welcome! This program is built to count your nucleotides. ')

#asking the user

if choice == 1:
